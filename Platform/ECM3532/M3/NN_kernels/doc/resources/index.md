**Tensai Flow NN Kernels** is a set of C kernel functions used in writing 
Neural Network models to be deployed on Eta Compute products. The kernels are 
provided as a pre-built library along with the Tensai Flow software. These 
kernels are also used by the Tensai Flow Compiler when generating the C code 
for inference on boards like ECM3532.
